# Teaching

Here's a list of my Treehouse courses and workshops.

## Coming Soon

### [Building Services with ASP.NET Web API](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/building-services-with-aspnet-web-api/upcoming)

**Available October 2017**

Services expose data and processes through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) implemented using common approaches or standards. Decoupling our back-end from our front-end makes it possible for our services to support multiple client apps. We can even allow other developers and organizations to consume and use our services to further broaden the reach of our applications.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the ASP.NET Web API framework to build a RESTful service or HTTP API. As you learn about Web API, you'll create a service for the Fitness Frog single-page web app (SPA) developed using Angular.

## Available Now

### [Entity Framework Query Performance](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/entity-framework-query-performance)

In this workshop, you'll learn how to audit Entity Framework queries and resolve common performance issues.

### [Entity Framework Data Concurrency](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/entity-framework-data-concurrency)

In this workshop, you'll learn about data concurrency and how to implement optimistic data concurrency controls using Entity Framework.

### [Entity Framework with ASP.NET MVC](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/entity-framework-with-aspnet-mvc)

In this course, you'll learn how to use Entity Framework within the Comic Book Library Manager web app—a web application developed using the ASP.NET MVC web framework. You'll work on completing this web app so that users can create, update, and delete comic books from their digital library.

Throughout this course you'll learn by example by completing hands-on coding exercises. See how to put EF related code into its own class library project, retrieve and persist data from within a web app, organize your data access code using popular design patterns, and more!

### [Entity Framework Migrations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/entity-framework-migrations)
