Surface Pro 4 vs Surface Book Comparison

I went to the Microsoft Store last night to take a look at the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. This is the second time that I've done this in the last month. Here are my thoughts:

Surface Pro 4

This seems to be a good refinement to the Surface Pro 3. Slightly thinner and lighter, slightly larger and higher resolution screen, much improved keyboard and trackpad (glass vs plastic). Here's a detailed comparison between the two:

The new Surface Dock provides lot of additional ports and power through a single connection to the device (the dock works with the Surface Book as well). I could easily see how a Surface Pro 4 along with the dock, a couple of monitors, keyboard, and mouse would make a great setup.

Surface Book

Obviously the big difference between this and the Surface Pro 4, is that the Surface Book is an actual laptop. In the short time that I used the keyboard and trackpad, they seemed pretty decent (better than most Windows laptops), though I suspect that I would ultimately prefer the MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad. Detaching the screen from the base and holding the screen in your hands (as a tablet) will blow your mind; it's unbelievably light and the screen looks great.

The overall construction feels top notch, though there is some wobble between the base and screen, so it doesn't feel quite as solid as a MacBook Pro.

Comparison

The Surface Pro and Surface Book use the same materials and construction, which is to say that they are built solid and have a legitimate feel to them, not unlike Apple's products. The Surface Book is noticeably heavier than the Surface Pro 4, but I think the versatility of the Surface Book (gives you both a laptop and tablet) gives it the edge over the Surface Pro 4. I find myself working away from a desk often, so the Surface Book seems like the more practical option as trying to use the Surface Pro 4 on your lap doesn't seem like the ideal situation.

Which configuration???

Expensive???

Comparison to HP Spectre 360???
