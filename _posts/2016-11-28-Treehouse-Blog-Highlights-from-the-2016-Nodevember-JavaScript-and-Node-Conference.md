[Nodevember](http://nodevember.org/) is a two-day conference touching on all aspects of [JavaScript](http://teamtreehouse.com/learn/javascript)Â and Node. The third annual conference was held on November 20th and 21st in Nashville, Tennessee at the Lipscomb University campus. It featured 6 keynote speakers, 48 session talks, and an all-day workshop by [Kyle Simpson](https://twitter.com/getify) the day before the conference started.

This year, two Treehouse teachers, [Guil Hernandez](https://teamtreehouse.com/guil) and [myself](https://teamtreehouse.com/jameschurchill), were selected by the organizers to give presentations at this year's conference. Guil gave a presentation titled "Introduction to React Router" and I gave a presentation titled "Exploring TypeScript" (more about these presentations in just a bit). We were excited and honored to be given the opportunity to participate in the conference.
