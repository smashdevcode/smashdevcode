Over the last month or so, I finally got over my "get off my lawn" old-man reaction to generative AI (specifically ChatGPT) and started ramping up on the topic. I'm starting at a point of needing to learn more about machine learning, large language models, or anything AI-related, so I've got a lot of ground to cover.

One of the things I've started to do is to get back into listening to technically oriented podcasts. It's a great way to engage my mind while I'm out for my lunchtime walk around the neighborhood.

Below are the podcasts I've listened to (in the order I listened).

Have you listened to any of these podcasts? What did you think? Are there any podcasts that you'd add to this playlist?
