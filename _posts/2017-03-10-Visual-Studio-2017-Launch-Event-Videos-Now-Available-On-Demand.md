I presented two sessions this week as part of the live training for the Visual Studio 2017 Launch event. The videos for these sessions are now available on demand via Microsoft's Channel 9.

My involvement in the Visual Studio 2017 Launch event came about through a partnership between Treehouse and Microsoft (specifically the .NET team). For more information about the event, see [my post on the Treehouse blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/treehouse-partners-microsoft-release-visual-studio-2017).

## Getting Started with ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017

ASP.NET Core is an open-source (github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern web apps using .NET. It is a significant redesign of ASP.NET that is built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 
In this module, we'll create a simple app using both the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI) and the latest tooling available in Visual Studio 2017. Along the way, we'll also take a look at some of the key new concepts and features that are part of ASP.NET Core and how they compare to the ASP.NET that you know and love.

## Exploring and Migrating to TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It can help you be more productive and write higher quality code. That's all great, but migrating an existing JavaScript project to TypeScript can seem like a daunting proposition.
 
Luckily, benefiting from TypeScript doesn't require you to migrate your entire project to TypeScript. You can benefit from TypeScript by making incremental changes to your project.
 
In this module, you'll learn the basics of the TypeScript language and how to incrementally migrate a project to TypeScript. You'll also see how Visual Studio 2017 leverages the TypeScript Language Service to provide a rich JavaScript development experience including features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. And you'll see how to use JSDoc comments and TypeScript Declaration (d.ts) files to refine the TypeScript Language Service's understanding of your code.
