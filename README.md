## Reference

## Theme

### Dark version of jekyll-clean theme

This theme was created on top of Jekyll Clean theme by Scotte, you can view the original version in action [on his blog](https://scotte.github.io).

* Get it from [github](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark).
* See the [live demo](http://pavelmakhov.com/jekyll-clean-dark).
* See it [in action on my own blog](http://pavelmakhov.com).

This theme uses some parts of Twitter Bootstrap, which allows it to look nice on a mobile devices using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the sidebar.

Optionally you can use:

* [Disqus](http://disqus.com) as a comments system;
* [Google Analyticse](http://www.google.com/analytics/);
* [Yandex Metrika](http://metrica.yandex.com);
* Blog tags.

All these features could be set up in `_config.yml`. Also you can have social icons which could lead to your social accounts. Out-of-the box it has: LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow, LastFm, Instagram. You can easily add more by putting svg images in a /css/social folder.

Installation
==

If you don't have your own blog you can clone this repository and put your articles in a `_posts` folder. If you already have your own blog then I think you can clone this repository and copy-paste content keeping your `_posts` folder.

After you will have to set up your `_config.yml`
