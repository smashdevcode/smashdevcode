### 06/19-21 NodePDX Conference

**Demystifying TypeScript Decorators**

TypeScript decorators, based on the ES2016 decorator proposal and introduced as part of TypeScript 1.5, provide developers with a way to modify a JavaScript class, property, method, or method parameter using a convenient declarative syntax. We'll start this session by creating our own decorator, to see firsthand how they work. Then, we'll take a look at how decorators can be used in a variety of settings.

### 06/28 Portland TypeScript Meetup

**Working with TypeScript Definitions**

_With Peter Snider_

Your TypeScript code doesn't live in isolation. In fact, almost every application that you develop using TypeScript will need to interact with libraries or frameworks that are written in JavaScript. Sometimes this code is from a third party, sometimes it's your own.

TypeScript definition files allow you to leverage these assets in your projects, without having to sacrifice the benefits of working with pure TypeScript.

In this talk, we'll show how to use the command line tool Typings to find and consume definition files for popular libraries and frameworks. We'll also walk through the process of writing your own definition file, for those times when a library or framework (either third party or your own) doesn't have a definition file available.

### 07/13-15 Newbie Remote Conf

**Can Anyone Learn to Program?**

Are there innate abilities that make some people better suited to become programmers? Or can anyone learn to program? Does talent alone create success or can dedication and hard work make up for an initial lack of talent? This talk will examine the fixed and growth mindsets and what they can teach us about ourselves and how we can get (or stay) on the track to becoming a great developer.

### 09/01 Willamette Valley Software Engineers Meetup

**The Latest on TypeScript**

TypeScript, introduced by Microsoft in October 2012, is a strict superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and ES2015/++ language features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, decorators, async/await, and more. TypeScript's static typing allows tooling to provide richer support for features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. All of this together helps ease the development of JavaScript applications.

In this talk, we'll start with a brief history of TypeScript followed by a series of interactive demos that will show you the basics of the language. Then we'll look at some of the more advanced language features using Angular 2, React, and Node.js. We'll also see how popular editors like GitHub's Atom and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code provide support for working with TypeScript.

### 09/06 PADNUG (Portland Area .NET User Group)

**Getting Started with ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core (previously known as ASP.NET 5) is a new open-source (github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern web apps using .NET. It is a significant redesign of ASP.NET that is being built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this talk, we'll review the development history of ASP.NET Core, set up our development environment, explore the .NET Core (dotnet) CLI, and create a simple app–from the command line and using Visual Studio. Along the way, we'll also take a look at some of the key new concepts and features that are part of ASP.NET Core.
